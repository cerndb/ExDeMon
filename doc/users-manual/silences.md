# Silences

Actions generated by [triggers](monitor-triggers.md) can be ignored by using silences.

Silences are components like monitors that can be added and removed dynamically.

Configuration:

```
from = <yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss> (e.g: 2018-02-16 11:00:02)
to = <yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss> (e.g: 2018-04-16 11:00:02)
duration = <period like 15m, 1h, 1w> (if configured, "from" parameter must be set and "to" parameter is ignored) 
filter.expr = <expr> (as for metrics filter)
filter.attribute.<att> = <val>
filter.attribute.<att> = <val>
```

Silences will be active during the specified period.
If no period is configured, it will be always active till silence is removed.

During active period, actions that match filter will be dropped.

An example to silence all actions from a "http\_errors" monitor for the next to hour:

```
# "from" should configure current time
from = 2018-08-01 19:40:02
duration = 2h 
filter.attribute.$monitor = http_errors
```
